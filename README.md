# Hydrant

~ data-driven advice for classes ~

In order, the best five classes at MIT are probably (1)
1. `11.011`: The Art and Science of Negotiation 
2. `11.111`: Leadership in Negotiation: Advanced Applications 
3. `18.404`: Theory of Computation
4. `21G.502`: Japanese II
5. `17.317`: US Social Policy

But nobody knows this, so I bet e.g. US Social Policy is substantially underenrolled. 

We're making Hydrant to surface this information. Think [StateOfJS](https://stateofjs.com/) meets [firehose](firehose.guide). We'll look to target questions like:

* What are the best classes being offered this semester?
* What HASS concentration lets you take the best-rated classes?
* Is the professor teaching 18.03 next semester better or worse than average?

(1) You can figure this out if you run some bayesian statistics on the class rating and enrollment numbers.
