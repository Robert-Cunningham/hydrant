### Summary
You get a lot of practice negotiating in 11.011.

### Recommendation
11.011 deserves its reputation as the best class at MIT. Take this class if you have the time for it.

### Format
The class meets on Mondays and Wednesdays. On Monday, you negotiate with one or more of your classmates. On Wednesday, you regroup as a class to see the results and discuss how the negotiation went. 
On Friday morning, you turn in a 1500 word reflection. 
In addition, there's roughly three hours of reading each week.

### Pros
* The community in this class is very strong; people get to know each other very well.
* It's extremely fun, exciting, and instructive to negotiate against your classmates.
* Overall, the weekly readings are surprisingly interesting and relevant.

### Cons
* You have to apply. Many (most?) people apply once or twice before getting in. Make sure to pre-register and submit the application before the deadline.
* You'll spend a lot of late Thursday night / early Friday mornings writing reflections.
