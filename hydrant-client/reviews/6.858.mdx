6.858 has a mix of security content: some of it is modern and extremely interesting, and some of it feels outdated or unrealistic. 
In my opinion, the modern content is sufficiently interesting to justify taking the class.

The work for the class is twofold. 
First, there's an involved, hands-on lab due every two weeks. 
Second, before each class, you read that day's paper and submit a short question about it. 
Lectures are mostly summaries of the relevant papers, and can be skipped if necessary.

Some of the papers are fascinating and relevant (iOS security model, Spectre), and others less so (symbolic execution, baggy bounds checking).
Likewise, some of the labs are instructive, whereas others feel fake and unrealistic.
My two favorites were Lab 1, where you hand-craft a buffer overflow, and Lab 4, where exploit a host of common web vulnerabilities.

The staff are kind and knowledgable and the course is reasonably run.
