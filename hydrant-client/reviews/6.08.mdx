### Recommendation
Take this class if you're interested in picking up skills that are helpful for fun tech projects, or if you're not sure which part of EECS you'd like to go into! 

### Format
6.08 is six weeks of lectures + labs, a midterm, and a final project period.

### Prerequisites
You should have some basic understanding of programming, but they teach you pretty much everything you need to know!

### Pros
* You'll get a good exposure to different areas of EECS! 
* You learn valueable & applicable skills that can help you take on fun projects! (Working with ESPs/Arduinos, working with sensors, setting up a server, working with APIs, etc.)
* Joe is a super great lecturer!

### Cons
* 6.08 is a lab class, so it does take up a lot of time in the beginning since there are 2 2.5 hour lab sessions per week.
* it can be a lot if you don't have programming experience going in, so definitely recommend taking 6.0001 beforehand!
