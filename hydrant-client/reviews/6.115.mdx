### Summary
You spend the bulk of 6.115 wiring together integrated circuits and hand-writing assembly for the Intel 8051 microcontroller. 

### Recommendation
Take this class if you're interested in eventually building circuit boards for stuff like bluetooth headphones or electric skateboards.
I spent roughly 100 hours modernizing my knowledge after 6.115 concluded, and now feel confident in designing these kinds of PCBs.

### Format
6.115 is a series of six labs and one quiz. In the labs, you build circuits to drive displays, motors, and more.

### Prerequisites
You should have seen some circuits before taking 6.115, but you don't really need to remember anything complicated about solving them. For example, if you've forgotten everything about inductors, that's totally fine.

### Pros
* Since you hand-write all the assembly, you'll come away with a deep understanding of how microcontrollers are architected (e.g., how do interrupts work?). This understanding generalizes well to modern chips.
* You become comfortable reading IC datasheets, and learn a bunch of opaque but important terminology. In the class, you deal with ICs that do boring things (ADCs, DACs, etc.), but the skills generalize well to chips that do interesting things (bluetooth, gyroscopes, charge controllers, etc.).
* You become very proficient with an oscilloscope.

### Cons
* 6.115 is taught with old hardware. The Intel 8051 was developed in 1980, and although it still sees some use today, the market is quickly moving towards ARM chips (e.g. Cortex-M series).
* We spent more time hand-tuning very precisely timed 8051 assembly than I would have preferred.
* Some time spent at the end of the course on Cypress PSoC, which felt a bit toyish.
